Version 2.3.1

- Switched constructors to return new type-safe `instancetype` instead of id, making it easier to use dot-syntax property accessors on basemodel singletons.

Version 2.3

- Removed the uniqueID property by default and replaced it with a more flexible `newUniqueIdentifier` class method. To re-enable the uniqueID property, add BASEMODEL_ENABLE_UNIQUE_ID to your project's preprocessor macros

Version 2.2.2

- Added support for the HRCoder library, which provides human-readable object serialisation and de-serialisation using NSCoding

Version 2.2.1

- Fixed minor bug in setter name generation logic
- Removed deprecated property list serialisation methods

Version 2.2

- Added new instancesWithArray: method for loading an array of models in one go.

- Replaced instanceWithDictionary/Array: and initWithDictionary/Array: methods and replaced them with instanceWithObject: and initWithObject:

Version 2.1

- Added automatic support for ARC compile targets
- BaseModel is now designed to work hand-in-hand with the AutoCoding library, which provides completely automatic object serialisation via NSCoding
- NSObject (BaseModel) category has now been removed from the BaseModel library. You can now find this functionality in the AutoCoding library instead (https://github.com/nicklockwood/AutoCoding).
- Fixed a bug where `setUp` method could be called multiple times

Version 2.0
